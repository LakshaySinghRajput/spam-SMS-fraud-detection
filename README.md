# spam-SMS-fraud-detection
"SMS fraud detection is a crucial process to identify and prevent fraudulent activities in messaging systems. By leveraging machine learning and data analytics, it detects patterns, anomalies, and malicious content in real-time.

Project Overview
This project aims to classify SMS messages as spam or non-spam using machine learning techniques. The process includes analyzing the dataset, preprocessing the text data, experimenting with various models, and evaluating their performance. The same methodology can also be applied to detect spam emails, as the underlying principles remain consistent.

Key Steps in the Project
1️⃣ Data Analysis

Analyzed the dataset to identify patterns and key features related to spam detection.
Observed that:
Word Count and Sentence Count showed redundancy, so both were removed.
Character Count had a strong positive correlation with spam and was retained.
2️⃣ Text Preprocessing

Performed the following steps to clean and standardize text data:
Converted all text to lowercase.
Separated words by tokenizing text.
Removed special characters, stop words, and punctuation.
Applied stemming to reduce words to their root form.
3️⃣ Model Building

Tried multiple classification models, including:
Logistic Regression
Naive Bayes
Random Forest
Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4️⃣ Prediction

Created a test text message to validate the model.
Predicted whether the message was spam or non-spam based on its content.
Relevance to Email Spam Detection
The techniques used in this project, such as text preprocessing, feature selection, and classification, can be applied to email spam detection. Both SMS and email spam detection involve analyzing text content to identify patterns indicative of spam.

Key Takeaways
Proper text preprocessing is crucial for improving model accuracy.
Feature selection (e.g., keeping character count) helps reduce redundancy and improves model performance.
The methodology is adaptable to other domains, such as email spam detection or even fake review identification.
